# Library Management System

## Description

The **Library Management System** is a simple Java-based project that allows for the management of a collection of books in a library. It provides functionalities for adding books, removing books, and retrieving details about the library collection. This system uses a `HashSet` to store books, ensuring no duplicate entries exist, and includes methods to display and manage the data effectively.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library, ensuring no duplicates are allowed.
- **Delete Books**: Remove specific books from the library.
- **View All Books**: Display all the books currently available in the library.
- **Book Count**: Get the total number of books in the library.
- **`HashSet` for Book Storage**: Efficient storage and management of books using Java's `HashSet`.
- **Override Methods**: Custom `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods to define book uniqueness and how books are represented in output.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Data Structures**: `HashSet`
- **IDE**: Any Java-supported IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.)

## Project Structure

```
|-- src/
|   |-- Book.java           # Class for Book entity with attributes like book name, author, and price.
|   |-- Library.java        # Contains Library class to manage books using a HashSet.
|   |-- UseLibrary.java     # Main class to demonstrate the functionality of the Library class.
|-- README.md
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Book Class (`Book.java`)**:
   - Represents a book with the following attributes:
     - `bookName`: Name of the book.
     - `author`: Author of the book.
     - `price`: Price of the book.
   - **`equals()`**: Determines if two `Book` objects are the same based on their `bookName`, `author`, and `price`.
   - **`hashCode()`**: Generates a unique hash for each book, ensuring `HashSet` can manage uniqueness correctly.
   - **`toString()`**: Provides a string representation of a `Book` object, used for easy output of book details.

### 2. **Library Class (`Library.java`)**:
   - Manages a collection of books using a `HashSet<Book>` to store `Book` objects.
   - **Methods**:
     - `addBook(Book b)`: Adds a book to the `HashSet`. Returns `true` if the book is successfully added (i.e., itâ€™s not a duplicate).
     - `getBookCount()`: Returns the total number of books in the library.
     - `getAllBooks()`: Returns the `HashSet` containing all the books in the library.
     - `Delete(Book b)`: Removes the specified book from the library and provides confirmation.

### 3. **UseLibrary Class (`UseLibrary.java`)**:
   - Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the Library Management System.
   - Example books are created and added to the library. The program showcases how to add, retrieve, and delete books from the `Library`.

## Example Code

```java
// Example of adding books to the library
Book b1 = new Book("Life is a myth", "Yograj", 99);
Book b2 = new Book("Existence of God", "Yograj", 999);
Library library = new Library();
library.addBook(b1);
library.addBook(b2);

// Retrieve all books
System.out.println("All books in the library: " + library.getAllBooks());

// Remove a book
library.Delete(b1);
System.out.println("Book removed. Remaining books: " + library.getAllBooks());
```

## HashSet Explanation

The **`HashSet`** data structure is used to store books in the library. This ensures that each book is unique (no duplicates). A `HashSet` provides constant-time performance for basic operations like adding and removing elements, making it an efficient choice for managing the collection.

Key methods:
- **`add()`**: Adds an element to the `HashSet` only if it doesn't already exist.
- **`remove()`**: Removes a specified element if it is found in the `HashSet`.
- **`size()`**: Returns the total number of elements in the `HashSet`.

In your `Library` class, books are added and removed using these methods. The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in the `Book` class ensure that two books are considered equal if they have the same name, author, and price, which prevents duplicate entries in the `HashSet`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UniverseOfYograj/java-projects-yograj.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `LibraryManagementSystem` folder and open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Compile and run the `UseLibrary.java` file to see the system in action.

4. Follow the prompts in the `main()` method to add, view, and delete books.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the system more user-friendly.
- Integrate a database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) to store book data persistently.
- Add functionality to update book details.
- Implement search features to find books by name, author, or price range.
